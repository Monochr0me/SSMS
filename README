SSMS - Sourcemod Server Management System

Uploaded first batch of the tool, its still packed with bugs features and things to do but at least others can now
also take a look at it and maybe improve it since i dont always have to time to do so.

Install -

Copy over all the files to your folder, update the config.php to fit your needs (dont fill in what you dont have/need)
You can import your servers if you have them in hlstats or just use the gui to do a addserver in the start (might behave
a bit badly with no servers in it)

Also create a database and insert the ssms.sql file found in the repository root too.

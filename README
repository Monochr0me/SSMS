SSMS - Sourcemod Server Management System

Uploaded first batch of the tool, its still packed with bugs features and things to do but at least others can now
also take a look at it and maybe improve it since i dont always have to time to do so.

Install -

Copy over all the files to your folder, update the config.php.exaple and rename it to config.php
to fit your needs (dont fill in what you dont have/need) You can import your servers if you have
them in hlstats or just use the gui to do a addserver in the start (might behave
a bit badly with no servers in it)

Also create a database and insert the ssms.sql file found in the repository root too.

To update it automaticly dont forget to add a crontab, as example: 
*/1 * * * * cd /home/lethal/public_html/admin/ && php servers.php -u > /dev/null 2>&1

For updates on the plugin id's and version matching do this (only do it once! and if possible change the time a bit random)
58 05 * * * cd /home/lethal/public_html/admin/ && php dbplugins.php -u > /dev/null 2>&1
